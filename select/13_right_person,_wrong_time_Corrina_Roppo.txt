I don't bring you up anymore in conversation cuz my friends are tired of hearing about it, and I get it
So, everything I feel I leave unsaid
But you're still in my head and heart
I can't escape the good parts
Like the version of us sitting pretty in your three bedroom
Making plans for our life too soon
Wrapped in red, we were classic
Before my heart turned to plastic

Was it all a lie or just the right person wrong time
Did you know I loved you my whole life and I will, I will still
We were everything I ever wanted
A dream I was living euphoric til it all fell outta line
Right person, wrong time
Oh right person wrong time

I blame you for how I can't listen to the music I used to love
Cuz when I do, I think of you and I start missing your touch
Do you remember dancing in the living room?
Holding me at the concert too
Singing loud through the traffic
Kissing me feeling magic?

Was it all a lie or just the right person wrong time
Did you know I loved you my whole life and I will, I will still
We were everything I ever wanted
A dream I was living euphoric til it all fell outta line
Right person, wrong time
Oh right person, wrong time

Thought it was a dream come true
Then I learned that me and you were never meant to be
So obvious

So obvious
