I comb my hair, I brush my teeth
I close my eyes, I’m counting sheep
But sleep ain’t coming to me
Easy, these days
So I give up, I check my phone
I lie awake, I feel alone
Then I reread the things that
We said, instead
Maybe it’s just one of those things
Toe to toe with myself in a boxing ring
What’s the point
When we gave it our all
Just to watch it all fall?
I guess the universe sent me
The right person
At the wrong time
Yeah he came along
And he blew my mind
He showed me what
It’s like to love
Fearlessly
The right person
At the wrong time
Love, if we were older
Maybe we would be fine
It’s just as well
But it hurts like hell to say
Goodbye, baby
Your life’s unfolding through a screen
You don’t even meet me in my dreams
You changed your look and you seem
Distant, different
But I know you, we were first friends
I love you now and I loved you then
So if it’s hard, don’t say it
Isn’t, listen
Maybe it’s just one of those things
Toe to toe with yourself in a boxing ring
What’s the point?
Babe, we gave it our all
Just to watch it all fall
I guess the universe sent me
The right person
At the wrong time
Yeah he came along
And he blew my mind
He showed me what
It’s like to love
Fearlessly
The right person
At the wrong time (Wrong time)
Love, if we were older
Maybe we would be fine (We would be fine)
It’s just as well
But it hurts like hell to say
Goodbye, baby
Maybe one day
We’ll meet on the street
And I’ll look at him
And he’ll look at me
Oh, if there’s a chance
Then that’s all that I need
Because
He was
The right person
At the wrong time
Yeah he came along
And he blew my mind
He showed me what
It’s like to love
Fearlessly (Fearlessly)
The right person
At the wrong time (At the wrong time)
Love, if we were older
Maybe we would be fine (We would be fine)
It’s just as well
But it hurts like hell to say
Goodbye, baby
The right person at the wrong time
The right person at the wrong time
The right person at the wrong time
At the wrong time (Goodbye)
You came at the wrong time (Goodbye)
The right person at the wrong time
The right person at the wrong time
The right person at the wrong time
Goodbye, baby
