Cruel cannot describe it cause you're everything I want
But we got oceans that divide us
All this love that don't belong
Both our hearts came with a ceiling
Hand of cards that got dealt wrong
I can't move on
If I was born an hour later maybe we could have it all
Or maybe had a different star sign
One that wasn't built to fall
Timing never came on our side, separated by these walls
I tried to call
Right person wrong time
Hitting all the stop signs
Can't escape out of my mind
How can we be wrong when it feels right
It's out of my control, I know you're on the other side
But I wanna try
This love that I've been waiting for
It's something I can't have no more
How can we be wrong when it feels right
Right person, wrong time
Right person, wrong time
I hope that you find someone who's gon' love you like I do
I know it's selfish but from my side wish that somebody was you
Broken promises and red lights
Fate designed us both to lose
If I could change the stars
I'd break apart the walls that's stopping you
Right person wrong time
Hitting all the stop signs
Can't escape out of my mind
How can we be wrong when it feels right
It's out of my control, I know you're on the other side
But I wanna try
This love that I've been waiting for
It's something I can't have no more
How can we be wrong when it feels right
Right person, wrong time
Right person, wrong time
