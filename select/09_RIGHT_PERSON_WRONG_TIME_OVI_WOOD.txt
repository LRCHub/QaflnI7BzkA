Right person but the wrong timing
Came in my life and girl you left me smiling
Under the pain, hope there's a silver lining
Want you to stay, but you can't
You're gonna go
And I know I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone
I don't want you to go
But I'm better off alone
Ya ya
Girl I wish you knew the old me
The old me wasn't controlling
The old me wasn't so lonely
The old me wouldn't leave you broken
The new me been hurt too much
The new me's been burned too much
The new me don't deserve your love
The new me don't deserve no one
Trynna get better but I'm hurting deep
I want you here, why you wanna leave
Trynna get back to who I used to be
I'm missing you, is you missing me
I miss you when I wake up in the morning, na na na
And I miss you 'fore I go to sleep
Girl tell me am I important
Am I still your priority
Na na na na na
Right person but the wrong timing
Came in my life and girl you left me smiling
Under the pain, hope there's a silver lining
Want you to stay, but you can't
You're gonna go
And I know I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone
I don't believe in wrong time, lemme explain the reason
The right person always coming for the right season
And you lately, you been the one I'm needing
And you baby, you got my heart speeding
I knew you was special since the night we stayed up on the phone
We talked for hours like I knew you, we got hella close
So when you left me, it was hard for me to let you go
And you know
Shawty got that good love
Good love that I want
Shawty got that good love
I can't get enough
That good love, sent straight from above
That good love, love oh oh
