I'm broken inside
I was ill advised to fall for you
But I'd die for you

Caught me by surprise
We don't even fight so how's this true
But it all was true

Said we need to meet face to face
Just to tell me you needed space
Memories I can't erase my love

Said you needed time on your own
Too young but maybe when we're grown
But I can't keep waiting here my love

Hurts to breathe so I don't speak
Told me you would never leave so stay
Ay

The night you left's still haunting me
I know love has no guarantees my babe
But

Aren't you gonna come and save me
Im begging down on my knees
Aren't you gonna say you love me
Did you ever care for me?

I can't take one more heartbreak
I don't think I'll be fine
I thought you were perfect
Right person wrong time
Right person wrong

Time, I
Stay blind
Thinking you'll come back

Days die
Night skies
Lost without a map

Need to do this by myself
Friends check up on my mental health
I just lie and say I'm well my love

I laugh just to hold back tears
Know your gone but I want you here
Didn't this mean anything my love

Hurts to breathe so I don't speak
Told me you would never leave so stay
Ay

The night you left's still haunting me
I know love has no guarantees my babe
But

Aren't you gonna come and save me
Im begging down on my knees
Aren't you gonna say you love me
Did you ever care for me?

I can't take one more heartbreak
I don't think I'll be fine
I thought you were perfect
Right person wrong time
Right person wrong

Time
Right Person Wrong
Time

Aren't you gonna come and save me
Im begging down on my knees
Aren't you gonna say you love me
Did you ever care for me?

I can't take one more heartbreak
I don't think I'll be fine
I thought you were perfect
Right person wrong time
Right person wrong time
