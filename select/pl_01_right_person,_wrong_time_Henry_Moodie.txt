I heard that you're back in town
For the holidays at
your parents' house
The last time we spoke was
three years ago
But sometimes I still
think about
Sneaking out the window
When we were more than friends
What if one day we start again?
I don't know why
But I still believe in
you and I
(You and I)
And I don't know how
But I hope that one day
you'll come back around
(Back around)
And you'll say every road
I ever take
Leads to you, it's all the same
You're the one that got away
I don't know why
But I still believe our
stars will align
'Cause I'm just the
right person, wrong time
(Two, three, let's go!)
Sometimes when I close my eyes
I picture us in twenty
years time
Where it all worked out,
we bought a house and
settled down
I know we could do it if
we tried
Tried to grow a little wiser
Learn from our mistakes
I can't help but wanna say
I don't know why
But I still believe in
you and I
(You and I)
And I don't know how
But I hope that one day
you'll come back around
(Back around)
And you'll say
Every road I ever I take
Leads to you, it's all the same
You're the one that got away
I don't know why
But I still believe our
stars will align
'Cause I'm just the
right person, wrong time
London City
Late nights, tipsy
All these memories never
leave me
My friends, your place
Young dumb mistakes
All these memories I wish
we'd still make
I don't know why
But I still believe in you and I
I don't know how
But I hope that one day
you'll come back around
Back around
And you'll say
Every road I ever I take
Leads to you, it's all the same
You're the one that got away
I don't know why
But I still believe our
stars will align
'Cause I'm just the
right person, wrong time
